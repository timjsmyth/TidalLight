Look-up-tables (LUT) created from the original data of Spitschan

Following steps:
1) In octave (octave-cli) run 
~/ALAN/adam wright/radiative_transfer/twilight/IlluminationSpectraDataset/analysis/IlluminationSpectraDataset_Analysis_FullAnalysis.m

There is another modified (Matlab) script running in this called:
IlluminationSpectraDataset_Analysis_Absolute.m

This produces several spectral files in the LUT sub-directory

2) In the shell, run the script LUT/pasting_script.csh

This creates the files Rural_Twilight.csv and Urban_Twilight.csv at 1nm and 1 degree (of solar elevation) resolution
