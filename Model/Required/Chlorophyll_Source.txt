The Chlorophyll data source is taken from a third party subroutine "abcase2_NatGeo.f" provided by Dr.Tim Smyth PML. 
Original data presented in the script is sourced from the publications 
Smith and Baker, 1981, Applied Optics 20(2), 177-184
Prieur and Sathyendranath, 1981, Limnol. Oceanogr. 26(4), 671-689 for 400-700 nm; (data extended by eye to 350 nm)

Smith and Baker, 1981 data contains data for pure water instance. 

Prieur and Sathyendranath, 1981 contains the data used in this script as a reference index for spectral data for chlorophyll conversions.
